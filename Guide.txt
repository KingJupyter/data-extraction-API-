Before using this script, please read the PDF file "Washington DC Data.pdf" carefully to make sure you understand all the requirements.

This script is a web scraping script created using Python.
There are two versions in this folder: Distributed file(version 1) and SingleFile(version 2).
The results of both versions are the same, so you can use either version.

Version1: In this version, the script is divided into folders by steps.
So you can check all the steps through these folders.

Version2: This is a combined version of version1.
It contains only two files: singleFile.py and singleFile.bat.
I recommend using this version if you trust my abilities ðŸ¤£.
